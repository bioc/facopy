abstract = {Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is a microarray technology that allows one to detect and map genomic alterations. The standard workflow of the aCGH data analysis consists of 2 steps: detecting the boundaries of the regions of changed copy number by means of a segmentation algorithm (break point identification) and then labeling each region as loss, neutral, or gain with a probabilistic framework (calling procedure). In this paper, we introduce a novel calling procedure based on a mixture of truncated normal distributions, named FastCall, that aims to give aberration probabilities to segmented aCGH data in a very fast and accurate way. Both on synthetic and real aCGH data, FastCall obtains excellent performances in terms of classification accuracy and running time.},

Inference of tumor subpopulations has been disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic point mutations, whereas computational methods targeting evolutionary dynamics of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in whole genome sequencing data remain under-developed. We present a novel probabilistic model, TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from whole genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of breast tumors that inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically inform population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.},

abstract = {Cancer is known to have abundant copy number alterations (CNAs) that greatly contribute to its pathogenesis and progression. Investigation of CNA regions could potentially help identify oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and infer cancer mechanisms. Although single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have strengthened our ability to identify CNAs with unprecedented resolution, a comprehensive collection of CNA information from SNP array data is still lacking. We developed a web-based CaSNP (http://cistrome.dfci.harvard.edu/CaSNP/) database for storing and interrogating quantitative CNA data, which curated ???11,500 SNP arrays on 34 different cancer types in 104 studies. With a user input of region or gene of interest, CaSNP will return the CNA information summarizing the frequencies of gain/loss and averaged copy number for each study, and provide links to download the data or visualize it in UCSC Genome Browser. CaSNP also displays the heatmap showing copy numbers estimated at each SNP marker around the query region across all studies for a more comprehensive visualization. Finally, we used CaSNP to study the CNA of protein-coding genes as well as LincRNA genes across all cancer SNP arrays, and found putative regions harboring novel oncogenes and tumor suppressors. In summary, CaSNP is a useful tool for cancer CNA association studies, with the potential to facilitate both basic science and translational research on cancer.},

abstract = {Background: High-throughput genotyping microarrays assess both total DNA copy number and allelic composition, which makes them a tool of choice for copy number studies in cancer, including total copy number and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses. Even after state of the art preprocessing methods, allelic signal estimates from genotyping arrays still suffer from systematic effects that make them difficult to use effectively for such downstream analyses. Results: We propose a method, TumorBoost, for normalizing allelic estimates of one tumor sample based on estimates from a single matched normal. The method applies to any paired tumor-normal estimates from any microarray-based technology, combined with any preprocessing method. We demonstrate that it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of allelic signals, making it significantly easier to detect allelic imbalances. Conclusions: TumorBoost increases the power to detect somatic copy-number events (including copy-neutral LOH) in the tumor from allelic signals of Affymetrix or Illumina origin. We also conclude that high-precision allelic estimates can be obtained from a single pair of tumor-normal hybridizations, if TumorBoost is combined with single-array preprocessing methods such as (allele-specific) CRMA v2 for Affymetrix or BeadStudio's (proprietary) XY-normalization method for Illumina. A bounded-memory implementation is available in the open-source and cross-platform R package aroma.cn, which is part of the Aroma Project (http://www.aroma-project.org/).},

@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {Systematic investigations of genetic changes in tumors are expected to lead to greatly improved understanding of cancer etiology. To meet the analytical challenges presented by such studies, we developed the Cancer Genome WorkBench (http://cgwb.nci.nih.gov), the first computational platform to integrate clinical tumor mutation profiles with the reference human genome. A novel heuristic algorithm, IndelDetector, was developed to automatically identify insertion/deletion (indel) polymorphisms as well as indel somatic mutations with high sensitivity and accuracy. It was incorporated into an automated pipeline that detects genetic alterations and annotates their effects on protein coding and 3D structure. The ability of the system to facilitate identifying genetic alterations is illustrated in three projects with publicly accessible data. Mutagenesis in tumor DNA replication leading to complex genetic changes in the EGFR kinase domain is suggested by a novel deletion-insertion combination observed in paired tumor-normal lung cancer resequencing data. Automated analysis of 152 genes resequenced by the SeattleSNPs group was able to identify 91\% of the 1251 indel polymorphisms discovered by SeattleSNPs. In addition, our system discovered 518 novel indels in this data set, 451 of which were found to be valid by manual inspection of sequence traces. Our experience demonstrates that CGWB not only greatly improves the productivity and the accuracy of mutation identification, but also, through its data integration and visualization capabilities, facilitates identification of underlying genetic etiology.},
